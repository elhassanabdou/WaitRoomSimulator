The project simulate the WR as was requested in the assingment.
1- The main function runs the threads of the simulator.
2- There are 6 threads in addition to the main.
    1- The customer thread, that mimcs the arrival of the customers and generate tickets
    2- 4 counters threads that mimcs the counters
    3- closing thread which randomly put one of the counters to sleep
3- The threads will join at destruction of simulator which never happens. I did not imagine how the system will quit working.
4- The original parallel queue Datastructure had conditional variables to wake up and sleep threads on pushing and poping. It was removed because the counter needs to cont. pop the queue until it will sleep for 5 minutes as requested.
4- The project was generated by CMake with no dependencies on external library. It was tested on Linux mint OS. The linker rise error of -pthread and -atomic need which I added to linker. I am not sure if it needs something similar on Windows.
5- I compiled using C++17 standard. It should compile with no errors nor warnings.
